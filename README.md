# HR-Data-Analytics
HR Data Analytics portfolio project on a dataset of 80K records that deals with HR KPIs like Performance tracking, attrition rate. Project involved cleaning, transforming data and visualizing it to create a dashboard. I have used the MS Excel and Power BI's Query Editor for data cleaning and preprocessing and dashboard.
